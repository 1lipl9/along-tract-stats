 Overview
 --------
 
 This is a set of tools for conducting an along-tract analysis of white matter fiber tracts derived from diffusion MRI data. It allows you to analyze a scalar metric (e.g. fractional ansiotropy; FA) parameterized along a tract, rather than the more typical method of collapsing the variability in these measures into single tract-averaged mean estimates.
 
 This package contains 3 things:
 
 1. *Tools* - A modular set of MATLAB functions to perform individual tasks on the tract groups (load, plot, save, interpolate, etc.).
 2. *Experiment wrappers* - Several examples of how you can link these tools together to perform a full analysis. These will be a good starting point to adapt to your own needs.
 3. *Example data* - So you can get a feel for running these tools and verify that they are behaving the same way as in the example documentation.
